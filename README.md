# The PSF Technical Steering Committee
The Permissionless Software Foundation (PSF) Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is the technical governing body of PSF. It is described in the [TSC Charter](./tsc-charter.md). The model is inspired by this article on [Healthy Open Source](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/healthy-open-source-967fa8be7951) and is adapted from the [Node.js TSC](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC).

## TSC Scope

**The TSC is responsible for the PSF Core project, and a number of projects adjacent to PSF
Core.**

The TSC exercises autonomy in managing its responsibilities and seeks agreement
from the [PSF Stakeholders](https://t.me/psf_vip) on any change to the scope of those
responsibilities as defined below.

### PSF Core

*PSF Core* is defined as the [bch-api](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-api) REST API and [bch-js](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-js) JavaScript library which make up the middle section of the [Cash Stack](https://fullstack.cash/). The 'Cash Stack' is a framework for creating modern web and phone apps that can interact with the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.

### Adjacent Projects

Additional projects fall within the TSC's scope of responsibility which are
dependent on PSF Core as a foundational component to achieve some business use-case. Projects that are _adjacent_ are either created from within the technical organization managed by the TSC or are adopted into that organization from outside.

In the case of adopting existing projects, once the TSC has decided that adoption is appropriate, it should seek agreement from the [PSF Stakeholders](https://t.me/psf_vip) for such adoption as it impacts on the scope of technical activities of the Foundation, and funding the project represents dilution of value of the PSF token.

These projects will be listed here as they are developed and working groups are formed to manage them.

### List of TSC Responsibilities

The TSC exercises autonomy in setting up and maintaining procedures, policies,
and management and administrative structures as it deems appropriate for the
maintenance and operation of these projects and resources.

Included in the responsibilities of the TSC are:

* Managing code and documentation creation and changes for the listed projects
  and resources
* Setting and maintaining standards covering contributions of code,
  documentation and other materials
* Managing code and binary releases: types, schedules, frequency, delivery
  mechanisms
* Making decisions regarding dependencies of the Node.js Core project,
  including what those dependencies are and how they are bundled with source
  code and releases
* Creating new repositories and projects under the _nodejs_ GitHub organization
  as required
* Setting overall technical direction for the Node.js Core project, including
  high-level goals and low-level specifics regarding features and functionality
* Setting and maintaining appropriate standards for community discourse via the
  various mediums under TSC control
* Setting and maintaining governance rules for the conduct and make-up of the
  TSC, Working Groups and other bodies within the TSC's domain

Many of these responsibilities will be delegated by the TSC to appropriate
bodies such as the Working Groups.

## TSC Members

TSC members are responsible for top level technical community concerns. The role is mostly administrative and is responsible for admitting new Working Groups, and advocating for any needs in the technical side of the project to [PSF Stakeholders](https://t.me/psf_vip).

TSC members can nominate new members at any time. Candidates for membership tend
to be people who have a competency for community management and a high tolerance
and patience for process minutiae as the TSC delegates most of its responsibilities
to other projects and working groups.

A [current list of TSC members](./tsc_members.json) is maintained in this repository.

## YouTube
Many teams/groups post meeting videos to the [PSF YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ57IDXJJSYXHBLpF1tBD0g).

Any Workgroup member can request a video be posted to the YouTube channel by asking in the [PSF Telegram channel](https://t.me/permissionless_software).


## Top-Level Projects and Working Groups
Top-Level Projects (TLP) Working Groups (WG) are governed by a [project lifecycle](./project-lifecycle.md) and are empowered by the TSC.

* [Working Groups](working-groups.md)
* Top-Level Projects

 - [bch-js](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-js)

## Policy Change Proposal Process

The PSF TSC is chartered to oversee the technical governance of all Top Level Projects and Working Groups under PSF. The TSC establishes the default governance, conduct, and licensing policies for all Top Level Projects. Top Level Projects and Working Groups have broad powers of
self-governance.

To propose a change or addition to policies or processes that are intended to cover all Top Level Projects and Working Groups in the foundation, a PR should be opened in this TSC repository.

The pull request can be labeled `tsc-agenda` to request that it be put on the agenda for the next TSC meeting.

The [PSF Stakeholders](https://t.me/psf_vip) represent the financial backing of the PSF. If the TSC endorses a proposal, they will escalate it to that Telegram channel for discussion. Funding for any initiative will ultimately come from holders of the PSF token.

In some cases, existing individual groups have the right to refuse changes to their charters. The TSC can not mandate existing working groups alter their charters. If such a situation arises, the TSC may decide to revoke the group's charter.
